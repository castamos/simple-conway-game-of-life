# Conway's game of life

A simple implementation of game of life in Rust. I just want to learn the basic syntax of Rust. 


## Dependencies

Please install the SDL2 library and set the RUSTFLAGS, e.g.:

```code
export RUSTFLAGS="-L ${HOME}/opt/sdl2/lib"
```

## Build and run

Build as usual:

```code
cargo run
```
